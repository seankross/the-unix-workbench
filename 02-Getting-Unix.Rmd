## Mac & Ubuntu Users

If you're using a Mac or you're using the Ubuntu operating system find a
program called **Terminal** and open it. You can skip the next section about
Windows.

## Windows

If you're using version 1607 of Windows 10 or higher you should enable and install
Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can find the installation guide from Microsoft
[here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide).

If you don't have the latest version of Windows 10 you should download 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then set up the latest version of
Ubuntu with VirtualBox. Instructions for doing this tend to change slightly
over time, so I suggest using Google to search for "how to install Ubuntu on
Windows with VirtualBox" and then you can follow the instructions that you find.

# Nephology

> I saw a city in the clouds. - Dagobahnian proverb

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Nephology is the study of clouds. Few modern technology concepts (other than
maybe data science and artificial intelligence) have been hyped as loudly as "the
cloud." The cloud is simply a computer that we can access over the internet.
In this chapter, we'll set up a cloud computer and we'll learn the basics of
interacting with one.

To get the most out of this chapter, you're going to need your credit or
debit card, or a [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) account. We're going to be
using [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/530d6cfa2b37), a company that we
can rent cloud computers from. Throughout this chapter, I might refer to cloud
computers as **servers** (computers connected to the internet) or as
**droplets**, which is a marketing term DigitalOcean uses to refer to their
servers (a droplet is *not* a technical term). Renting from DigitalOcean won't
cost you any money since I'm giving you a coupon for free promotional credit!
There are several companies that offer similar services compared to
DigitalOcean, but in my opinion they have the best user interface and the most
transparent pricing model.

**Warning:** *At the end of this chapter, we will discuss how to shut down any
servers we've started on DigitalOcean. If you don't shut down your server
after two months, then your account will be charged real money for using
DigitalOcean. Please be sure to shut down any servers you start after you are
finished using them.*

## Setting Up DigitalOcean

To get started with DigitalOcean, we need to rent a server from their website.
[Click this link](https://m.do.co/c/530d6cfa2b37) to sign up for DigitalOcean
in order to set up a server for free. (If you don't use this link, then
you don't get promotional credit). Click **Sign Up** in the upper right corner,
then enter your email address and choose your password. (The screenshots below 
are slightly different from DigitalOcean's current website layout.)

![](images/do-main.png)

Check your email for a message from DigitalOcean and click the enclosed link to
confirm your email. Then you'll need to enter your credit or debit card
information, or your Paypal account details. As long as you close down all of
your servers less than two months after you start them, you will not be charged.
After entering in your payment information, you should see this screen:

![](images/do-create-drop.png)

Click the big blue **Create a new Droplet** button, which should then bring you
to a screen where you can customize the server you're going to be renting. Make
sure you have Ubuntu chosen as your distribution, and select the $5 per month
size option:

![](images/do-distro-size.png)

Scroll down the page and then select the region that is geographically closest
to you. Some regions have multiple data centers; it doesn't matter which data
center you pick. Currently I'm in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, so I'm going to pick
the number 1 data center in New York:

![](images/do-region.png)

Create a password that you will need to connect to your server.
Finally, at the bottom of the page, click the big green **Create** button in order
to start your server!

![](images/do-create-confirm.png)

It will take a minute to launch the server, but once launched
you should receive an email from Digital Ocean with best practices for setting up your
new server. On the droplet page, you should also be able to find the IP address of your
server. The default username should be `root`. Once you've gathered this information, 
open up a new terminal.

## Connecting to the Cloud

We can connect to computers on the internet with the `ssh` program, which
stands for **S**ecure **Sh**ell. The `ssh` command provides a command line
interface to whichever computer we point it to. A computer that is connected to
the internet has an address (just like a house has an address), which is
specified by an **IP address**. The command for connecting to a computer with
`ssh` generally looks like this:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ssh [username]@[IP address]
```

Let's connect to our DigitalOcean server using `ssh`. Enter the following
command in the terminal, substituting the IP address of your
DigitalOcean droplet for the IP address I'm using in this example:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ssh root@159.203.134.88
```

```
## The authenticity of host '159.203.134.88 (159.203.134.88)' can't be established.
## ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:UhtoIx/3c6/MmAIE+H8w5oGE06PsbXdzRRsAUhKtjhs.
## Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Type `yes` and then press Enter.

```
## Warning: Permanently added '159.203.134.88' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
## root@159.203.134.88's password:
```

This password should be the one you set up for your DigitalOcean droplet. Type 
the password into the terminal, then press Enter.

```
## You are required to change your password immediately (root enforced)

After entering the correct password, we should have a prompt! Press enter 
a few times to make sure that you get the prompt back each time. We're in!

Now we have access to all of the Unix commands we would normally have:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
pwd
```

```
## /root
```

In order to disconnect from the server and return to your machine, use `logout`.

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
logout
```

```
## Connection to 159.203.134.88 closed.
```

To reconnect to the server, use `ssh` again:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ssh root@159.203.134.88
```

```
## root@159.203.134.88's password:
```

Enter your password and you should get the prompt back for your cloud server.

### Summary

- `ssh` connects you to computers that are connected to the internet. The
template for the command to connect is `ssh [username]@[IP address]`.
- To disconnect from an `ssh` session, use the `logout` command.

## Cloud Computing Basics

### Moving Files In and Out of the Cloud

So now that we have a cloud computer, what can we do with it? One thing we
can do is store and retrieve files from a cloud computer. The program `scp`
allows us to copy local files to a server, and it allows us to copy files on
a server to our local computer. First let's connect to our server so we can
create a file there:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ssh root@159.203.134.88
```

```
## root@159.203.134.88's password:
## # (Enter your password)
```

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
mkdir textfiles
echo "From the server" > textfiles/server-file.txt
logout
```

```
## Connection to 159.203.134.88 closed.
```

Now that we're back at the prompt on our local machine, let's try getting
`server-file.txt` from our server. The arguments for copying files from a server
with `scp` have the following general structure:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
scp [username]@[IP address]:path/to/file/on/server path/on/my/computer
```

This copies the file located on the server at `path/to/file/on/server` to a
local path at `path/on/my/computer`. In the same way, we can copy an entire
folder from a server using the `-r` flag:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
scp -r [username]@[IP address]:path/to/folder/on/server folder/on/my/computer
```

Let's try doing this now from our local computer. Enter your password when
asked to do so:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cd
pwd
```

```
## /Users/sean/
```

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
mkdir Cloud
cd Cloud
scp root@159.203.134.88:/root/textfiles/server-file.txt downloaded.txt
```

```
## root@159.203.134.88's password:
## server-file.txt                                         100%   16     1.2KB/s   00:00
```

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cat downloaded.txt
```

```
## From the server
```

It worked! Now let's try uploading a file to our server. The arguments for doing
this are just the swapped arguments for downloading a file from a server:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
scp path/on/my/computer [username]@[IP address]:path/to/file/on/server 
```

Let's create a file and upload it to our server:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
echo "from local computer" > to-upload.txt
scp to-upload.txt root@159.203.134.88:/root/textfiles/uploaded-file.txt
```

```
## root@159.203.134.88's password:
## to-upload.txt                                           100%   20     1.8KB/s   00:00
```

Now let's log in to our server and we'll see if it's there:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ssh root@159.203.134.88
cat textfiles/uploaded-file.txt
```

```
## from local computer
```

Looks like it worked! Keeping files in the cloud allows you to work with the
same files in the same workspace as long as you have access to a terminal and
`ssh`.

### Talking to Other Servers

There are tons of servers out there on the internet! The way you're probably
used to talking to a server is through a web browser, but there are other ways
we can talk to servers on the command line. One of the most popular command line
programs for talking to other servers is `curl`. The `curl` command allows us
to send requests and information to other servers.

One easy task that we can use `curl` for is downloading files that are available
online. For example, this entire book and all of the files associated with it
are hosted on a server! You can find the Markdown file for one of the first
chapters of this book [here](http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/01-What-is-Unix.md).
To download a file with `curl`, we simply need to provide the `-O` flag and the
URL of the file:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl -O http://website.org/textfile.txt
```

Let's try downloading the Markdown file from my website:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl -O http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/01-What-is-Unix.md
```

```
##   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
##                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
## 100  1198  100  1198    0     0  13681      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 13770
```

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
head -n 5 01-What-is-Unix.md
```

```{r, engine='bash', echo=FALSE}
head -n 5 docs/01-What-is-Unix.md
```

Looks like we got the file! The `curl` command is also commonly used for
communicating with **API**s. API stands for **a**pplication
**p**rogramming **i**nterface. APIs are a set of rules that allow us to
communicate with computer programs or with servers on the web. GitHub has a
[large API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), which allows us to find out
information about GitHub's users and repositories. Let's use `curl` to look 
at what programming languages are used by some of my repositories. Let's start
with the repository for this book:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl https://api.github.com/repos/seankross/the-unix-workbench/languages
```

```
{
  "CSS": 2615,
  "TeX": 22
}
```

It looks like most of the repository is dedicated to making the book website
look pretty! Take a look at the URL in the `curl` command above, and let's
dissect it a little bit. The API itself is located at `https://api.github.com/`.
Then each word in the rest of the URL acts as a sort of argument. We're
interested in `repos` in this case, specifically a repo belonging to the
username `seankross` called `the-unix-workbench`, and we want to know about
which `languages` are used in that repo. Let's take a look at one more of my
repositories just to see how the response can be different:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl https://api.github.com/repos/seankross/lego/languages
```

```
{
  "R": 4197,
  "Shell": 442
}
```

Use of `curl`, especially when coupled with using APIs, can become very
complicated, and much more advanced content has been written on the subject.
Let's get a little more in depth by looking through some of the examples from
[httpbin.org](http://httpbin.org/). This website allows us to send requests to
it with `curl`, and it will return to us a structured version of whatever
information we sent. This is useful for debugging our `curl` commands. First,
let's send a request that should return our IP address:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl http://httpbin.org/ip
```

```
{
  "origin": "159.203.134.88"
}
```

Looks like we're getting the response we expect. Before we go on, I should
clarify: `curl` sends **HTTP requests**. HTTP is a technology for sending
information over a network, and HTTP powers much of how the internet works.
There are different categories of HTTP requests, and the categories are often
called **verbs**. When we use `curl` without any flags, we are sending a
**GET** request (GET is an HTTP verb). A GET request is a message that says to
a server: "Hi, I live at [IP address]. Would you mind sending some information
about yourself to that IP?" In the case above, we asked for our own IP address,
which httpbin.org knew to just send back to us.

Let's send a general HTTP GET request to http://httpbin.org/get:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl http://httpbin.org/get
```

```
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "close",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.47.0"
  },
  "origin": "159.203.134.88",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

The text that we get back from the request specifies four information groups:
`args`, `headers`, `origin`, and `url`. The `origin` shows our own IP address,
and `url` shows where we sent the request. The `headers` group shows some
interesting information, including the `User-Agent`, which shows that httpbin.org
knows that we sent this request with `curl`. Notice that the `args` group is
empty. The `args` group is short for *arguments*, which hints at the fact that
we can provide arguments in an HTTP request, just like arguments we would use
for a function, or the arguments we used in the GitHub API.

In the general case, we can provide arguments to an HTTP API by putting a
question mark (`?`) after the API's URL. Let's try this out:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl http://httpbin.org/get?Baltimore
```

```
{
  "args": {
    "Baltimore": ""
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "close",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.47.0"
  },
  "origin": "159.203.134.88",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get?Baltimore"
}
```

Looks like `"Baltimore"` showed up in `args`! For most HTTP APIs, we need to
give names to our arguments, unlike most arguments in Bash. We can specify
an argument's name with the template `[argument name]=[argument value]`. Let's
take a look at a simple example:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl http://httpbin.org/get?city=Baltimore
```

```
{
  "args": {
    "city": "Baltimore"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "close",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.47.0"
  },
  "origin": "159.203.134.88",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get?city=Baltimore"
}
```

Now we can see that, in `args`, there's a correspondence between `city` and
`Baltimore`. We can add more named arguments by separating them with an 
ampersand (`&`):


```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl "http://httpbin.org/get?city=Baltimore&state=Maryland"
```

```
{
  "args": {
    "city": "Baltimore",
    "state": "Maryland"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "close",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.47.0"
  },
  "origin": "159.203.134.88",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get?city=Baltimore&state=Maryland"
}
```

Perhaps you could imagine building a server that accepts HTTP requests, and
sends back different information depending on what arguments are provided (for
example, send back a weather report given a location). Building these kinds of
servers is an advanced topic that is outside the scope of this book, but there
are lots of resources out there if you're interested in building your own HTTP
API on a web server.


### Automating Tasks

One of the most compelling features about any web server is that it's always
powered on and always connected to the internet. This means that we can instruct
our server to perform tasks automatically, without us needing to enter a command
into a shell. One of the most commonly used programs for executing *other programs*
with a regular frequency is called `cron`. Let's take a look at how to use
`cron` to schedule a program to be run.

If you're not already connected to the server, use `ssh` to connect.

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ssh root@159.203.134.88
```

The `cron` program is part of a family of programs called **daemons**. A daemon
is a program that is always running in the background of our computer. First, 
let's see if `cron` is running. We can get a list of all running programs
with the `ps` command while using the `-A` flag:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ps -A
```

```
##  PID TTY          TIME CMD
##    1 ?        00:00:13 systemd
##    2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
##    3 ?        00:00:03 ksoftirqd/0
##    5 ?        00:00:00 kworker/0:0H
##    7 ?        00:00:11 rcu_sched
##    8 ?        00:00:00 rcu_bh
##    9 ?        00:00:00 migration/0
## ...
```

You probably have a huge list of programs in your terminal now! Instead of
sifting through this listing line by line, let's pipe the output of this command
to `grep` and look for `cron`:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
ps -A | grep "cron"
```

```
##  1273 ?        00:00:01 cron
```

Looks like the `cron` daemon is running! In order to assign programs to be
executed with `cron`, we need to edit a special text file called the `cron`
table. Before we edit the `cron` table, we need to select the default text
editor. If you like using `nano` (the text editor we've been using throughout
this book), then enter `select-editor` into the console, type in the number
that corresponds to `nano` (usually `2`), and then press enter:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
select-editor
```

```
## Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.
##   1. /bin/ed
##   2. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
##   3. /usr/bin/vim.basic
##   4. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
## 
## Choose 1-4 [2]:
```

Now that we've chosen a text editor, we can edit the `cron` table using the
command `crontab -e` (**`cron`** **tab**le **e**dit), which will automatically
open `nano` with the appropriate file.

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
crontab -e
```

```
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command

```

Let's go over the layout of the `cron` table. First you should notice that any
text after a pound sign (`#`) is a comment, so it's not seen by `cron` (just
like bash comments). The `cron` table has six columns:

1. Minute (`m`)
2. Hour (`h`)
3. Day of Month (`dom`)
4. Month (`mon`)
5. Day of Week (`dow`)
6. Command to be run (`command`)

Each column is separated by a single space in the table. The first five columns 
allow you to specify when you want a particular command to be run. Only certain 
values are valid in each column:

1. Minute: `00 - 59` (A particular minute in an hour)
2. Hour: `00 - 23` (0 is the midnight hour)
3. Day of Month: `01 - 31` (1 is the first day of the month)
4. Month: `01 - 12` (1 is January)
5. Day of Week `0 - 6` (0 is Sunday)

There are also a few other characters that are valid in the `cron` table. The
most commonly used character is a star (`*`), which represents *all* of the
possible values in a column. So a star in the Minute column means "run every
minute," and a star in the Hour column means "run during every hour."
Knowing this, let's make our first entry in the `cron` table. If we want a
command to be executed every minute, during every hour, on every day of the
month, during every month, on every day of the week, then we can put stars in
all of the first five
columns, followed by the command that we want to run. In this case, the command
that `cron` will run every minute will be `date >> ~/date-file.txt`, which will
append the date and time when the command is executed to a file in our home
directory called `date-file.txt`. This is what your `cron` table should look
like before you save and exit from `nano`:

```
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * date >> ~/date-file.txt
```

Save and exit `nano` just like you would for a regular text file and then wait
a little bit! After a minute has gone by use `cat` to look at `~/date-file.txt`:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cd
cat date-file.txt
```

```
## Thu Jun  8 18:50:01 UTC 2017
```

Looks like our entry in the `cron` table is working! Wait another minute and then
look at the file again:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cat date-file.txt
```

```
## Thu Jun  8 18:50:01 UTC 2017
## Thu Jun  8 18:51:01 UTC 2017
```

Unless we delete the line that we entered in the `cron` table, the output from
`date` will be appended to `date-file.txt` every minute.

The single line of bash `date >> ~/date-file.txt` is a much simpler program than
we would probably use in a `cron` table, though it's good for illustrating how
a `cron` table works. If you want to do more complex tasks with `cron`, it's
better for `cron` to execute a bash script that you've written in advance. That
way you can just specify `bash /path/to/script.sh` in the last column of the
table.

Using stars in all columns is the simplest line of a `cron` table, so let's 
look at some examples of more complex table entries:

```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
00 * * * * bash /path/to/script.sh     # Runs every hour at the start of the hour
00 12 * * * bash /path/to/script.sh    # Runs every day at noon
* 12 * * * bash /path/to/script.sh     # Runs every minute between 12pm and 12:59pm
00 00 05 * * bash /path/to/script.sh   # Runs the 5th day of every month at midnight
00 00 * 07 * bash /path/to/script.sh   # Runs every day in the month of July at midnight
00 00 * * 2 bash /path/to/script.sh    # Runs every Tuesday at midnight
```

Besides numbers and the star, there are a few other characters that you can use
in `cron` table columns, including a hyphen (`-`) for specifying ranges and a
comma (`,`) for specifying lists of items. For example, `00-29` in the Minutes
column would specify the first thirty minutes of an hour, while `1,5` in the
Day of Week column would specify Monday and Friday.

Let's take a look at another example of a `cron` table that uses hyphens and 
ranges, so you can get a sense of how each character works.

```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
00-04 * * * * bash /path/to/script.sh       # Runs every minute for the first five minutes of every hour
00 00 * * 0,6 bash /path/to/script.sh       # Runs at midnight every Saturday and Sunday
00 03 01-15 * * bash /path/to/script.sh     # Runs at 3am for the first fifteen days of every month 
00,30 * * * * bash /path/to/script.sh       # Runs at the start and middle of every hour
00 00,12 * * * bash /path/to/script.sh      # Runs every day at midnight and noon
00 * 01-07 01,06 * bash /path/to/script.sh  # Runs at the start of every hour for the first seven days of the months of January and June
```

A program that is being run by `cron` is only as powerful as your imagination
can stretch! If you're familiar with the social network
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/), then you might have come across some Twitter
accounts that create posts automatically, like
[Emoji Aquarium](https://twitter.com/emojiaquarium),
[Old Fruit Pictures](https://twitter.com/pomological), or
[Endless Screaming](https://twitter.com/infinite_scream). Many of these "bot"
accounts are powered by `cron`, which uses Twitter's HTTP API to post tweets
regularly.

### Summary

- `scp` copies files between a cloud computer and your personal computer. Use
the `-r` flag in order to copy directories.
- `curl` allows you to send HTTP requests to other servers. Use the `-O` flag to
download files with `curl`.
- `ps -A` lists all of the programs running in the background of your computer.
- `cron` allows you to schedule when programs are run. Use `crontab -e` in order
to edit the `cron` table.

### Exercises

1. Write a bash script that takes a file path as an argument and copies that
file to a designated folder on your server.
2. Find a file online that changes periodically, then write a program to
download that file every time it changes.
2. Try creating your own Twitter or GitHub bot with the 
[Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) or the
[GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

## Shutting Down a Server

In order to avoid using more DigitalOcean credits than we have to or
being charged for using the service, make sure to **destroy** any DigitalOcean
droplets that you started. When you destroy a droplet, all files
on it are gone forever, so please be sure that you don't have any
important information on a droplet before you destroy it. If there are files
you want to save on your droplet, use `scp` in order to copy them to your local
machine. Let's walk through destroying a droplet. Go back to 
[DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/530d6cfa2b37) and log in. You should then see
a listing of all of your droplets:

Click on **More** on the right side of the screen and a menu should appear.
Click **Destroy** at the bottom of this menu. Then this screen should appear:

Click the **Destroy** button and then click **Confirm** in the menu that pops
up. Your droplet should now be destroyed. If you have no active droplets, then
the main droplets page should look like this:

Congratulations on your new cloud computing skills!
